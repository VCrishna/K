## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm is included in the installation.

After installing Node.js and npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required node modules:

```
npm install
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder in your project directory and install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

Once the installation is complete, you can start the application by running:

```
ng serve
```

This will start the Angular development server and the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.
